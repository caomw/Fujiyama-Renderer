Fujiyama Renderer v0.0.6(Alpha) Release Notes
=============================================

New features since v0.0.5
-------------------------
 * SplineWispsProcedure plugin is now available. This fills volume with millions of
   specks along spline before rendering a volume primitive.

 * fujiyama.ShowPropertyList is now available. This command will show the list of
   properties of a type or a plugin. for example,

     import fujiyama
     si = fujiyama.SceneInterface()
     si.ShowPropertyList('Volume')

   This code will show all properties and their type (scalar, vector2, ...).
   When listing plugin's properties, the plugin needs to be opened before this call.

 * Jittered pixel sampling is now implemented. This adds jittered offset to sampling
   position within each sub-pixel.

 * Improved the performance when rendering oriented volume primitives. When gathering
   intervals that rays need to march, intersect test now takes orientations of volume
   primitives into account.

 * Fixed a lots of minor bugs and updated documentation.
