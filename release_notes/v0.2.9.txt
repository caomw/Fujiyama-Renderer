Fujiyama Renderer v0.2.9(Alpha) Release Notes
=============================================

New features since v0.2.8
-------------------------
 * fbview now can show rendering progress by displaying tiles that renderer
   finished rendering. In order for fbview to receive image data from renderer,
   run this,

     $ fbview --listen
  
   This command starts fbview in listening mode. When fbview is listening
   (to renderer), it receives images data from renderer. If fbview is
   already opened, then you can press 'l' to turn listening mode on/off.

   To terminate render process from fbview, press 'ESC' key. It will wait for
   all ongoing tiles are done. Note that if you terminate render process
   by typing Ctrl + C in your shell, then renderer stop rendering without
   notifying fbview. After this, you can recover by hitting 'l' TWICE on fbview.

   The broken line along image indicates the status of the fbview.
     > gray   - listening mode off
     > blue   - listening mode on, ready to receive data from renderer
     > green  - listening mode on, in progress of rendering
	 > yellow - terminating render process, waiting for all ongoing tiles are done
	 > red    - incomplete render process, terminated by ESC key

 * Since fbview and renderer communicate with each other using TCP/IP,
   you need to have propper settings for firewall.

 * Fixed a lots of minor bugs and updated documentation.
