Fujiyama Renderer v0.1.7(Alpha) Release Notes
=============================================

New features since v0.1.6
-------------------------
 * Added callback capability to hook rendering progress from host applications.
   There are 5 points where you can hook the progress.

     1. When fujiyama starts rendering a frame
     2. When fujiyama finishes rendering a frame
     3. When fujiyama starts rendering a tile
     4. When fujiyama finishes rendering a tile
     5. When fujiyama finishes sampling a sub pixel

   If you return CALLBACK_CONTINUE, then fujiyama will keep rendering, otherwise
   returning CALLBACK_INTERRUPT, then it stops rendering.

   Typically, on finishing sampling you decide to interrupt rendering or not.
   And on finishing tile rendering, you copy the contents of frame buffer.

   See scenes/cube.c for actual code.

 * The fbview switched to GLSL to display individual image channel, instead of
   glMatrixMode(GL_COLOR) since it is still an ARB_imaging extention.

 * Divided top level Makefile into individual ones for each library and tool.
   This makes it easy to see how to build custom shaders and your own tools.

 * Added fixed-size integer type to make the random module behave the same.

 * Fixed a lots of minor bugs and updated documentation.
