Fujiyama Renderer v0.1.0(Alpha) Release Notes
=============================================

New features since v0.0.9
-------------------------
 * Grid light and sphere light have been implemented. Gird light has a option that
   switches single/doulbe-sided illumination.

 * Area light features needed some small changes in shading process. Shaders used to
   loop over lights in scene before but now they need to loop over light samples.

 * 'shadow_target' property is added to ObjectInstance. This enables to select
   target object group in scene for shadow rays. If 'shadow_target' is carefully
   selected and set to proper instances, rendering with area light will get faster.

 * SiNewObjectGroup and SiAddObjectToGroup are added to scene interface. Users are now
   able to create object groups through the interfaces.

 * Fixed a lots of minor bugs and updated documentation.
