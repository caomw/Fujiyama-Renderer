Fujiyama Renderer v0.0.8(Alpha) Release Notes
=============================================

New features since v0.0.7
-------------------------
 * Camera motion blur has been implemented. It interpolates transform values not its matrix
   so that it can solve accurate matrix in sample time.

 * Removed camera properties 'position' and 'direction'. Added 'translate', 'rotate',
   'transform_order' and 'rotate_order' instead. This means that users have to compute
   transform data from look-at direction if needed.

 * Added new scene interfaces called SiSetSampleProperty3. It assigns properties
   in the specified sample time.

 * Fixed a lots of minor bugs and updated documentation.
