Fujiyama Renderer
=================

  Overview
-----------------
Fujiyama is free and open source, distribution oriented ray-tracing renderer
designed to handle production image rendering. 
* Compatibility - written in pure ANSI C (x)
* Portability - depends on no external library (xx)
* Simplicity - requires only single C interfaces header file and library
* Compact - the size of core library is about 100Kb
* Open Source - licensed under the terms of MIT License (See LICENSE)
   (x) fb2exr is written in C++
   (xx) some external tools require OpenEXR and OpneGL/GLUT

  Features
-----------------
Below are the implemented features so far.
* Original mesh format - ply2mesh is provided
* Original mipmap format - hdr2mip is provided
* Original framebuffer format - fb2exr is provided
* On demand reading of mipmap - unlimited number of texture images
* Pluggable shader DSO - shaders can be written in C/C++
* Object instance - saves memory usage
* On demand construction of accelerator - avoids unnecessary construction
* Grid accelerator - for meshes (dense distribution)
* BVH accelerator - for object instances (sparse distribution) 
* Command-like scene description language - works with text filter tools
* Region rendering - accelerates distribution rendering pipeline
* Gaussian and Box pixel filters - supports filter width bigger than 1 pixel
* FrameBuffer Viewer - provided in the distribution
* Uniform grid pixel sampling
* Tile based rendering 

  Install
-----------------
* make
* make check | grep FAIL
* make prefix=/path/to/install install
   - OpneGL/GLUT is required for FrameBuffer Viewer
   - OpenEXR is required for fb2exr
