* Compact - the size of core library is about 100Kb
* Open Source - licensed under the terms of MIT License

(x) fb2exr is written in C++
(xx) some external tools require OpenEXR and OpneGL/glut

  Features
-----------------
Below are the implemented features so far.
* Original mesh format - ply2mesh is provided
* Original mipmap format - hdr2mip is provided
* Original framebuffer format - fb2exr is provided
* On demand reading of mipmap - unlimited number of texture images
* Pluggable shader DSO - shaders can be written in C/C++
* Object instance - saves memory usage
* On demand construction of accelerator - avoids unnecessary construction
* Grid accelerator - for meshes (dense distribution)
* BVH accelerator - for object instances (sparse distribution) 
* Command-like scene description language - works with text filter tools
* Region rendering - accelerates distribution rendering pipeline
* Gaussian and Box pixel filters - supports filter width bigger than 1 pixel
* FrameBuffer Viewer - provided in the distribution
* Uniform grid pixel sampling
* Tile based rendering
